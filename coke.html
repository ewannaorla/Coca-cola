    <h1>Coca-cola: Universal Appeal?</h1>

<p>
    On April,1996,Douglas N. Daft,the president of the Middle and Far East Group for Coca-cola Company was in a qandary.Coca-cola's strategy had always been to take risks in emerging markets. Even in tough markets, Coca-cola ultimately wins market share.For instance,during apartheid in South Africa,the company stayed in the country by maintaining a presence through independent bottlers while Pepsi left the country.Coke now dominates the market.

    <p>
       Coca-cola is investing heavily in bottling operations in order to maximize the strength and production,distribution and marketing.The company has <b>three</b> criteria for making a bottling investment:
        <ol>
            <li>The company needs to move quickly in an emerging market</li>
            <li>When an existing bottler lacks the resources to meet the company's objective</li>
            <li>To help ensure long-term strategic alignment with key bottling partners</li>
        </ol>
     </p>
